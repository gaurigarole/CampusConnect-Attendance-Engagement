# CampusConnect ‚Äì Student Attendance & Engagement Hub

This repository contains Phase 3 deliverables for CampusConnect implemented as Salesforce DX metadata. Phase 3 focuses on Record Types, Page Layouts, Compact Layouts, Relationships, and documentation to improve usability and the data model.

## ‚úÖ Phase 3 Summary

- ‚úÖ `Lecture__c` custom object with two Record Types: `Online_Lecture`, `Offline_Lecture` (controls `Mode__c` picklist).
- ‚úÖ Junction object `StudentCourse__c` (many-to-many Student ‚Üî Course) with two Master-Detail fields.
- ‚úÖ Master-Detail: `Attendance__c.Student__c` (Attendance record belongs to Student).
- ‚úÖ Lookup: `Lecture__c.Faculty__c` (Lecture assigned to a Faculty).
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical relationship field on User: `Supervisor__c`.
- ‚úÖ User role picklist: `Campus_Role__c` (Student, Faculty, Administrator) to emulate User Record Type variability.
- ‚úÖ Page Layouts: Student, Faculty, Course, Lecture, plus three User layouts (Student/Faculty/Administrator).
- ‚úÖ Compact Layouts: Student, Faculty, Lecture and assigned to their objects.
- ‚úÖ Tabs added: `Lecture__c`, `StudentCourse__c`.
- ‚úÖ Sharing models aligned: detail/junction set to ControlledByParent where applicable.

Notes
- The standard User object does not support Record Types in Salesforce. To meet the ‚ÄúStudent / Faculty / Administrator on User‚Äù requirement, this project provides a `Campus_Role__c` picklist and three dedicated User page layouts. Assign these layouts to profiles to get per-role experiences.
- ‚ÄúBusiness Processes‚Äù only apply to specific standard objects (Leads, Cases, Opportunities, Solutions). They aren‚Äôt applicable to `Lecture__c`.

- `force-app/main/default/objects/User/fields/` contains `Campus_Role__c`, `Supervisor__c`

## Relationships Implemented (with examples)

- Lookup: `Lecture__c.Faculty__c`
  - Example: A lecture ‚ÄúIntro to AI‚Äù is linked to Faculty ‚ÄúDr. Rao‚Äù.
- Master-Detail: `Attendance__c.Student__c`
  - Example: Attendance entries roll up under each Student (sharing controlled by parent).
- Hierarchical (User ‚Üí User): `User.Supervisor__c`
  - Example: Administrator supervises Faculty, Faculty supervises Student assistants.
- Junction: `StudentCourse__c` between `Student__c` and `Course__c`
  - Example: A student is enrolled in many courses, and each course has many students.

## Page Layouts

- Student__c ‚Äì shows core student info plus related lists:
  - Attendance__c (fields: Name, Course, Date, Status)
  - StudentCourse__c (fields: Name, Course)
- Faculty__c ‚Äì shows core faculty info and related Lectures (Mode, Scheduled At)
- Course__c ‚Äì shows related StudentCourse junction records
- Lecture__c ‚Äì shows Mode, Faculty, Scheduled At
- User ‚Äì three layouts (Student, Faculty, Administrator) surface `Campus_Role__c` and `Supervisor__c`

## Compact Layouts

- Student_Compact ‚Äì Name, Roll No, Attendance %, Email
- Faculty_Compact ‚Äì Name, Department, Email, Phone
- Lecture_Compact ‚Äì Name, Mode, Faculty, Scheduled At

## Setup & Deployment

1) Authenticate to your Dev org

Using the newer `sf` CLI:
sf org login web -a campusconnect-dev

Or using legacy `sfdx` CLI:
sfdx force:auth:web:login -a campusconnect-dev

2) Deploy all metadata in this repo (source format)

Using `sf` CLI:
sf project deploy start -d force-app -o campusconnect-dev

Or using `sfdx` CLI:
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u campusconnect-dev

3) Profile & layout assignments

- User Record Types are not supported. Use the `Campus_Role__c` picklist to categorize users.
- Assign the three User page layouts to the appropriate profiles (Student, Faculty, Administrator) via Setup:
  - Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí User ‚Üí Page Layouts ‚Üí Page Layout Assignment ‚Üí Edit Assignment
  - Map profiles to `User-Student User Layout`, `User-Faculty User Layout`, `User-Administrator User Layout`.
- If you maintain dedicated custom profiles for Student/Faculty/Admin, also confirm object permissions for Student__c, Faculty__c, Course__c, Lecture__c, Attendance__c, StudentCourse__c.

4) Assign Lecture record types to profiles

- Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Lecture ‚Üí Record Types ‚Üí Assign to Profiles
- Ensure both `Online_Lecture` and `Offline_Lecture` are visible to relevant profiles.

## Schema Builder Diagram (add to repo)

Use Schema Builder to visualize objects and relationships:
- Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Schema Builder
- Include: Student__c, Faculty__c, Course__c, Lecture__c, Attendance__c, StudentCourse__c, User
- Take a screenshot and save it as `docs/Phase3_Schema.png`
- Commit the file to this repository and reference it in issues/PRs.

## How Phase 3 Improves CampusConnect

- ‚úÖ Clear role-driven UX via User layouts and Campus_Role picklist
- ‚úÖ Faster record previews with compact layouts
- ‚úÖ Accurate data model for attendance and enrollment with MD and junction relationships
- ‚úÖ Better reporting with Lectures linked to Faculty and Students linked to Courses
- ‚úÖ Governance-ready metadata with SFDX source and deploy scripts

## üöÄ Phase 4: Process Automation (NEW)

Phase 4 implements comprehensive process automation using Salesforce's declarative tools:

- ‚úÖ **Validation Rules**: Attendance future date checks, event date validation
- ‚úÖ **Record-Triggered Flows**: Attendance alerts, event status updates
- ‚úÖ **Screen Flows**: Faculty attendance marking interface
- ‚úÖ **Approval Processes**: Course enrollment and special leave approvals
- ‚úÖ **Email Alerts**: Low attendance notifications, faculty alerts
- ‚úÖ **Field Updates**: Automatic status updates based on business rules
- ‚úÖ **Tasks & Notifications**: Faculty follow-up tasks, student event reminders

üìñ **[View Complete Phase 4 Documentation](docs/Phase4_Process_Automation.md)**

### Quick Phase 4 Setup
1. Deploy the new metadata: `sf project deploy start -d force-app -o YourOrgAlias`
2. Activate flows in Setup ‚Üí Flow Builder
3. Configure approval processes and assign approvers
4. Test automation with sample data
